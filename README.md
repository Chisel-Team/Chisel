Chisel
=======
Chisel is a mod for Minecraft which adds aesthetic blocks to the game through the use of a chisel.  

Originally created by AUTOMATIC_MAIDEN, it was ported to Minecraft 1.7.2 by asie, and maintained by Pokefenn/Cricket during 1.7.10.

This version of the mod contains loads of new blocks, new features like the Auto Chisel and chisel modes, and lots of bugfixes.

There is also a WIP 1.8 port.

It is maintained by [tterrag](github.com/tterrag1098), [Drullkus](github.com/Drullkus) (Artist), and [minecreatr](github.com/minecreatr) (1.8 Port).

Pull Requests
---------------

Pull requests with new features, translations, and bugfixes are very welcome. Please make sure to always submit PRs against the ***dev*** branch, not master.

Do not make PRs that are solely formatting or other aesthetic things.

If your PR is going to take a lot of work, it may be best to make an issue so we can discuss the feature before you create it.

See the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more details.
