Chisel 2
=======
Chisel is a mod for Minecraft which adds aesthetic blocks to the game through the use of a chisel.  

Originally created by
AUTOMATIC_MAIDEN, it was ported to Minecraft 1.7.2 by asie, and maintained by Pokefenn during 1.7.10.

The second iteration of the mod contains loads of new blocks, new features like the autochisel and chisel modes, and lots of bugfixes.

It is maintained by [Cricket](github.com/TheCricket), [tterrag](github.com/tterrag1098), [warlordjones](github.com/warlordjones), [Drullkus](github.com/Drullkus) (Artist), and [CptSpaceToaster](github.com/CptSpaceToaster).

Pull Requests
---------------

Pull requests with new features, translations, and bufixes are very welcome. Please make sure to always submit PRs against the ***dev*** branch, not master.

Do not make PRs that are solely formatting or other aesthetic things.

If your PR is going to take a lot of work, it may be best to make an issue so we can discuss the feature before you create it.

See the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more details.
